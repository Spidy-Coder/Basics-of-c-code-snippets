//stack memory:-
//It has a fixed value of size for
//which an array could be declared 
//in the contiguous form. 
 


//Heap Memory:-
//It is the memory where the array declared is not stored in a contiguous way. 
//If we want to declare an array of size 100000, we do not have the contiguous
// space in the memory of the same size.
// We will be declaring the array using heap memory as it
// necessarily doesnâ€™t require a contiguous allocation; it will allocate the
// space wherever it gets and links all the memory blocks together.
 

//NOTE:- GLOBAL VARIABLES ARE STORED USING HEAP MEMORY

//The memory declaration using 
//heap memory is known as dynamic memory allocation,
// while the one using stack is known as
//compile-time memory allocation.
